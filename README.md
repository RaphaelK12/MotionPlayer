**brief**: MotionPlayer is a player that can play the animation file in stick mode. Now it support BVH,ASE,TRC. This player has two tracks, you can play two files in the same time.

**note**: this project depends on my motionLib repo, and is built with QtCreator 4.7.0 and mingw(32bit). You can create a new Qt project, then copy src files to your project.
